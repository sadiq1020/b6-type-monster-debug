                <h3>Difference between LocalStorage and SessionStorage:</h3> <br>
                <p>One of the major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration
                    date.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        LocalStorage preserve the data untill manually remove the data. So even if the domain is
                        opened
                        in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no
                        expiration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On the other hand, sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session
                        lasts as
                        long as the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new
                        window, this
                        creates a new session and new storage.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <h3>Difference between Global scope and Block scope:</h3> <br>
                <p><strong>Global scope: </strong>Any variable that is defined outside the function scope and block
                    scope is called global scope. It means those variables can be acceesd from any where of that
                    program, any function and block scope.</p> <br>
                <p><strong>Block scope: </strong>Block scope is one of the sub-type of local scope. The block scope
                    can be
                    defined as
                    the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets { }. Now, these curly brackets can be of
                    loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these
                    variables from within the curly brackets { }.</p>
